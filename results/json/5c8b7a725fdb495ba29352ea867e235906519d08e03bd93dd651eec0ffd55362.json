For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    new_list = [ ]\n    largest = 0\n    while lst :\n        for i in lst :\n            pass\n            if ( i [ 1 ] > largest ) :\n                largest = i [ 1 ]\n                ref_count = i\n        new_list = ( new_list + [ ref_count ] )\n        lst . remove ( ref_count )\n        largest = 0\n    return new_list\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 36.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    new_list = [ ]\n    largest = 0\n    while lst :\n        for i in lst :\n            if ( i [ 1 ] > largest ) :\n                largest = i [ 1 ]\n                ref_count = i\n        new_list = ( new_list + [ ref_count ] )\n        lst . remove ( ref_count )\n        largest = 0\n    return new_list\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 35.0}
