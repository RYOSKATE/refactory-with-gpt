For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( sort ) :\n    ref_slist = [ ]\n    while sort :\n        biggest = sort [ 0 ]\n        for i in range ( len ( sort ) ) :\n            if ( sort [ i ] [ 1 ] > biggest [ 1 ] ) :\n                biggest = sort [ i ]\n            else :\n                continue\n        ref_slist . append ( biggest )\n        sort . remove ( biggest )\n    return ref_slist\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 44.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    sort = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        biggest = lst [ 0 ]\n        for i in range ( len ( lst ) ) :\n            if ( lst [ i ] [ 1 ] > biggest [ 1 ] ) :\n                biggest = lst [ i ]\n            else :\n                continue\n        sort . append ( biggest )\n        lst . remove ( biggest )\n    return sort\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 37.0}
