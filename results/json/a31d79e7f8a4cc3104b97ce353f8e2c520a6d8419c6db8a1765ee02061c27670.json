For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    ref_new = [ ]\n    for ref_x in lst :\n        biggest = 0\n        for i in ref_new :\n            if ( ref_x [ 1 ] < i [ 1 ] ) :\n                biggest += 1\n        ref_new . insert ( biggest , ref_x )\n    return ref_new\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 36.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    answer = [ ]\n    for i in range ( len ( lst ) ) :\n        biggest = lst [ i ]\n        for a in range ( i ) :\n            if ( lst [ a ] [ 1 ] > biggest [ 1 ] ) :\n                biggest = lst [ a ]\n        answer . append ( biggest )\n    return answer\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": null}
