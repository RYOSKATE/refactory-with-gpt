For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( result ) :\n    ref_result = [ ]\n    while result :\n        if True :\n            pass\n        ref_largest = result [ 0 ]\n        for ref_x in result :\n            pass\n            if ( ref_x [ 1 ] > ref_largest [ 1 ] ) :\n                ref_largest = ref_x\n            pass\n        result . remove ( ref_largest )\n        ref_result . append ( ref_largest )\n    return ref_result\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 61.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    n = len ( lst )\n    result = [ ]\n    while ( n != 0 ) :\n        test = [ ]\n        for counter in range ( n ) :\n            test . append ( lst [ counter ] [ 1 ] )\n        first = max ( test )\n        for counter in range ( n ) :\n            if ( lst [ counter ] [ 1 ] == first ) :\n                result . append ( lst . pop ( counter ) )\n        n = len ( lst )\n    return result\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": null}
