For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    if ( lst == [ ] ) :\n        return lst\n    else :\n        ( age_lst , new_lst ) = ( [ ] , [ ] )\n        for x in lst :\n            age_lst . append ( x [ 1 ] )\n        while age_lst :\n            max_age = max ( age_lst )\n            for i in lst :\n                if ( i [ 1 ] == max_age ) :\n                    new_lst . append ( i )\n                    age_lst . remove ( i [ 1 ] )\n        return new_lst\n    pass\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 8.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    if ( lst == [ ] ) :\n        return lst\n    else :\n        age_lst = [ ]\n        new_lst = [ ]\n        for x in lst :\n            age_lst . append ( x [ 1 ] )\n        while age_lst :\n            max_age = max ( age_lst )\n            for i in lst :\n                if ( i [ 1 ] == max_age ) :\n                    new_lst . append ( i )\n                    age_lst . remove ( i [ 1 ] )\n        return new_lst\n    pass\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 13.0}
