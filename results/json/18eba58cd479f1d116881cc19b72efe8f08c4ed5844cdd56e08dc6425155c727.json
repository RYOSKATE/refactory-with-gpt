For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    new = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        small = lst [ 0 ] [ 1 ]\n        name = lst [ 0 ] [ 0 ]\n        for ele in lst :\n            if ( ele [ 1 ] > small ) :\n                small = ele [ 1 ]\n                name = ele [ 0 ]\n        new . append ( ( name , small ) )\n        lst . remove ( ( name , small ) )\n    return new\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 2.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    new = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        small = lst [ 0 ] [ 1 ]\n        name = lst [ 0 ] [ 0 ]\n        for ele in lst :\n            if ( ele [ 1 ] > small ) :\n                small = ele [ 1 ]\n                name = ele [ 0 ]\n        new . append ( ( name , small ) )\n        lst . remove ( ( name , small ) )\n    new . reverse ( )\n    return new\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": null}
