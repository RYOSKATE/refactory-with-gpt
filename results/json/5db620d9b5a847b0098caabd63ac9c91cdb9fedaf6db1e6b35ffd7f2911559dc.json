For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    decoy = [ ]\n    decoy2 = [ ]\n    final = [ ]\n    for i in lst :\n        decoy . append ( i [ 1 ] )\n    while ( decoy != [ ] ) :\n        decoy2 . append ( max ( decoy ) )\n        decoy . remove ( max ( decoy ) )\n    for i in decoy2 :\n        for j in lst :\n            if ( i == j [ 1 ] ) :\n                final . append ( j )\n    return final\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 2.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    decoy = [ ]\n    decoy2 = [ ]\n    final = [ ]\n    for i in lst :\n        decoy . append ( i [ 1 ] )\n    while decoy :\n        decoy2 . append ( max ( decoy ) )\n        decoy . remove ( max ( decoy ) )\n    for i in decoy2 :\n        for j in lst :\n            if ( i == j [ 1 ] ) :\n                final . append ( j )\n    return final\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 5.0}
