For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    ref_a = [ ]\n    b = lst . copy ( )\n    lst . clear ( )\n    for i in b :\n        ref_a += [ i [ 1 ] ]\n    if ( len ( range ( len ( ref_a ) ) ) > 0 ) :\n        for i in range ( len ( ref_a ) ) :\n            pass\n            for i in range ( len ( ref_a ) ) :\n                pass\n                if ( ( ref_a [ i ] == min ( ref_a ) ) and ( b [ i ] not in lst ) ) :\n                    lst . append ( b [ i ] )\n                    ref_a [ i ] = ( max ( ref_a ) + 1 )\n                pass\n            pass\n        pass\n    lst . reverse ( )\n    return lst\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 106.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    agelist = [ lst [ 0 ] ]\n    for i in lst :\n        if ( i [ 1 ] > agelist [ 0 ] [ 1 ] ) :\n            agelist . insert ( 0 , i )\n        elif ( i [ 1 ] < agelist [ ( - 1 ) ] [ 1 ] ) :\n            agelist . append ( i )\n        else :\n            for x in range ( len ( agelist ) ) :\n                if ( agelist [ x ] [ 1 ] < i [ 1 ] < agelist [ ( x + 1 ) ] [ 1 ] ) :\n                    agelist . insert ( ( x + 1 ) , i )\n    return agelist\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": null}
