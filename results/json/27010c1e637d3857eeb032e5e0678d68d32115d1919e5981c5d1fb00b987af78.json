For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    first = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        ref_oldest = lst [ 0 ]\n        for ref_i in lst [ 1 : ] :\n            pass\n            if ( ref_i [ 1 ] > ref_oldest [ 1 ] ) :\n                ref_oldest = ref_i\n        lst . remove ( ref_oldest )\n        first . append ( ref_oldest )\n    return first\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 48.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    first = lst [ 0 ] [ 1 ]\n    result = [ lst [ 0 ] ]\n    for x in lst [ 1 : ] :\n        if ( x [ 1 ] > first ) :\n            result . insert ( 0 , x )\n        else :\n            result . append ( x )\n    return result\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": null}
