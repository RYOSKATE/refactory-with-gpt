For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    sorted = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        ref_biggest = lst [ 0 ]\n        for elem in lst :\n            if ( elem [ 1 ] > ref_biggest [ 1 ] ) :\n                ref_biggest = elem\n        lst . remove ( ref_biggest )\n        sorted . append ( ref_biggest )\n    return sorted\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 25.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    sorted_lst = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        ref_oldest = lst [ 0 ]\n        for elem in lst :\n            if ( elem [ 1 ] > ref_oldest [ 1 ] ) :\n                ref_oldest = elem\n        lst . remove ( ref_oldest )\n        sorted_lst . append ( ref_oldest )\n    return sorted_lst\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 27.0}
