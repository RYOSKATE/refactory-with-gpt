For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    j = ( len ( lst ) - 1 )\n    for ref_i in range ( 0 , j ) :\n        for i in range ( ( ref_i + 1 ) , len ( lst ) ) :\n            if ( lst [ ref_i ] [ 1 ] < lst [ i ] [ 1 ] ) :\n                ( lst [ ref_i ] , lst [ i ] ) = ( lst [ i ] , lst [ ref_i ] )\n    return lst\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 53.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    j = ( len ( lst ) - 1 )\n    for ref_i in range ( 0 , j ) :\n        for i in range ( ( ref_i + 1 ) , len ( lst ) ) :\n            if ( lst [ ref_i ] [ 1 ] < lst [ i ] [ 1 ] ) :\n                ( lst [ ref_i ] , lst [ i ] ) = ( lst [ i ] , lst [ ref_i ] )\n    return lst\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 53.0}
