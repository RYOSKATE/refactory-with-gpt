For this question, you will be sorting tuples! We represent a person using a tuple (<gender>, <age>). Given a list of people, write a function sort_age that sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [(\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19), (\"M\", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [(\"M\", 30), (\"M\", 23), (\"F\", 19)]. You may assume that no two members in the list of people are of the same age.\n", "sample_correct_code_blocks": ["def sort_age ( newlist ) :\n    ref_newlist = [ ]\n    while newlist :\n        oldest = newlist [ 0 ]\n        for i in newlist :\n            if ( i [ 1 ] > oldest [ 1 ] ) :\n                oldest = i\n            else :\n                continue\n        newlist . remove ( oldest )\n        ref_newlist . append ( oldest )\n    return ref_newlist\n"], "gpt_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "patch_size": 11.0, "gpt_rep_code": "def sort_age ( lst ) :\n    newlist = [ ]\n    while lst :\n        oldest = lst [ 0 ]\n        for i in lst :\n            if ( i [ 1 ] > oldest [ 1 ] ) :\n                oldest = i\n            else :\n                continue\n        lst . remove ( oldest )\n        newlist . append ( oldest )\n    return newlist\n\n\n", "gpt_patch_size": 3.0}
