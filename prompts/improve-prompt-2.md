# Refine Code Instructions

## ME

Please refine the following instruction for ChatGPT: """

Discard your code, start from the model solution and modify it to be syntactically similar to the incorrect code.
You may remove redundant identifiers from the incorrect code to correct it.
"""

## ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's a refined instruction:

"Your current code's functionality doesn't match the reference solution. Begin with the reference solution as a base and adjust its syntax to resemble your original code. If there are unnecessary identifiers in your original code, feel free to omit them for accuracy."
