# Code Fixing Prompt

````
Please refine the following prompt: '''
As a Python programming expert, your objective is to correct the erroneous code provided. Follow these guidelines:

- Ensure the corrected code produces the same output and logic as the model solution.
- Make only essential modifications to the original code, preserving its essence.
- Start by listing all user-defined identifiers in the original code. Use as many of these identifiers as possible in your corrected version.
- Follow the output format.
- Your fixed code's semantics should mirror the model solution.
- Ensure the syntax of the corrected code closely resembles the flawed original, more so than the model solution.
- Retain variable and function names, comments, whitespaces, line break characters, parentheses, pass, break, continue statements, and any redundant expressions like list([]).
- Do NOT alter user-defined identifier names from the original code.
- Do NOT delete whitespaces, line breaks, parentheses, pass, break, continue statements, or any superfluous statements and function calls.

Sure, here's the refined prompt:

````vbnet
As a Python expert, your task is to rectify the given incorrect code. Adhere to the following guidelines:

- Your corrected code should generate the same output and logic as the provided model solution.
- Only make necessary changes, keeping the original code's essence intact.
- Begin by enumerating all user-defined identifiers from the initial code. Your corrected code should use as many of these identifiers as feasible.
- Adhere to the specified output format.
- Ensure the semantics of your corrected code match the model solution.
- Your amended code's syntax should closely mirror the original's, even more so than the model solution.
- Maintain variable names, function names, comments, whitespace, line breaks, parentheses, pass, break, continue statements, and any redundant constructs like list([]).
- Do NOT modify the names of user-defined identifiers from the original code.
- Avoid eliminating whitespace, line breaks, parentheses, pass, break, continue statements, or any non-essential statements and function calls.

Please refine the two prompts: """
- The semantics of your fixed code is different from the model solution code. Make the semantics of your fixed code completely same with the model solution code keeping the patch size small.
- The patch size is equal to or larger than the model solution code. Make the syntax of your fixed code more similar with the original code keeping the semantics of your fixed code completely same with the model solution code.

## ChatGPT

Certainly, here's a refined version of the two prompts:

```vbnet
- Your corrected code's semantics differ from the model solution. Ensure the semantics match the model solution while minimizing the patch size.
- Your changes are as extensive as or more extensive than the model solution. Adjust the syntax of your corrected code to closely resemble the original, ensuring the semantics align with the model solution.
I've tried to make them more concise and direct.
